  <h2>Definitions</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>Variable</dt>
    <dd>A value stored somewhere in memory, referenced by a name. The value can be of any type.</dd>

    <dt>Method</dt>
    <dd>A piece of reusable code that can be called arbitrarily. It has a name and accepts zero or more arguments, which exist as local variables within the method body.</dd>

    <dt>Class</dt>
    <dd>A blueprint for a collection of similar objects. Defines its objects attributes and methods. Objects are created by instantiating classes.</dd>

    <dt>Object</dt>
    <dd>A container that holds things: data (stored in properties/attributes) and methods to operate on the data. Objects have state, meaning they store values that they remember and that can be recalled later. Objects share attributes and methods with other objects instantiated from the same class, but remember values which are unique to that object.</dd>
